A. BPMN_Validation:
1. How to check the input is valid BPMN2 model?
2. How to check for non-allowed elements in the model? What elements are not allowed?
3. If there are more than one stateful data object, how to create a copy of the model for each data object? 
using flock migration?
4. How to break or exit from the execution of the program when certain conditions happens? 
(flock when an object has no incoming/outgoing and no unique activity/event node, exit and show information for user)
5. How to generate unique ID for created elements?
6. How to migrate the guard condition in the sequence flow?
7. Do I need to add the new migrated elements (ObjectNode, ObjectFlow, SequenceFlow, ..) if the element is new or no?
8. Do we need the empty migrate for Event and activity?
9. Does BPMN allow multiple incoming/outgoing sequence flows for events as well?
10. Filtering rules how to preserve the guards (R2 & R9)?
11. Filtering rules needs to clone (for loop) to modify elements in the loop?
12. Rule R5 simple path between AND gateways?
13. Collection equality (Bag, Sequence)? R9, R10?
