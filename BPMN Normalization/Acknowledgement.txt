I would like to thank my project supervisor, Dr Liping Zhao, 
for giving me the opportunity to delve into the model-driven development world. 
Her continuous support and guidance throughout the project and her valuable and 
positive feedback helped me to overcome all the difficulties.  

I am indebted to Professor Rik Eshuis and Professor Pieter Van Gorp, 
at The Eindhoven University of Technology, for sparing from their valuable time 
to answer my queries regarding their research work used here. 
Their invaluable explanations helped me to understand better the 
transformation approach used for the system. 

I am also grateful to Dr Dimitris Kolovos and Dr Louis Rose, at The University of York, 
for their contributions towards my Epsilon implementation. 
I would like to thank Dr Louis for reusing his PN2SC Epsilon implementation. 
I would also like to thank Dr Dimitris for his prompt and helpful answers to all 
my posted questions on the Epsilon online forum. 

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and all my friends 
around me for their continual encouragement and support. 
Without all these people, this thesis would have never been a reality.
